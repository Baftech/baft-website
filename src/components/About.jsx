We started this company with a simple goal: to make banking in India less of a headache and more of a smooth, dare we say... enjoyable experience.Somewhere between dodging endless forms and wondering if "technical glitch" was just a lifestyle, we figured there had to be a better way to do things. So, armed with ambition, caffeine, and a shared love for solving messy problems, we got to work and BAFT Technology was born.At BAFT, we build smart, seamless solutions that cut through the clutter of traditional banking. No more confusing interfaces, endless queues, or mysterious errors. Just clean, user-friendly tools designed for real people.`}
